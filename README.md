# IBR-CNNs
Imaging-based representation (IBR) of thermal proteomes.
For temperature-series thermal proteomes, proteins were quantified by high-resolution mass spectrometry to obtain protein denaturation curves, which can reflect thermal stability and the change of ligand-induced thermal stability of proteins. Thus, protein denaturation curves might be directly used as an imaging feature, for the identification of potential drug targets.
